This is a repository for version 2.0 of the MemeMe app for Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree.

MemeMe is a Swift iOS app that can be used to create image macro memes. See the Wikipedia page
here for more details on image macros: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_macro.  Users can
create memes from pictures in the device's album or by taking pictures with the camera.  The
app also allows users to share a meme using the iOS activity controller.
